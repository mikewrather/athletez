Development Process
Ticket System
1.	All work done should be associated with a ticket.  If a ticket doesn’t exist for what you need to work on, create the ticket and be sure to include a time estimate.
2.	Set a ticket to “Accepted” when work begins on any ticket.
3.	Update oDesk status to reflect the ticket you’re working on.
4.	Don’t set more than 3 tickets to “accepted” at once.  Once you finish tickets, you can accept more.
5.	Tickets over 6 hours should be broken down into multiple tickets before work is started.  Tickets with large hourly estimates can be created as placeholders, but no work should be done on those tickets until they are fleshed out with detail and broken down.
6.	At the start of each week, review all the tickets you plan on working on.  If you need something that isn’t already available, leave a comment asking us to provide it as soon as possible.  This should be several days BEFORE you start work on the ticket.  It might takes us a few days to get you what you need.
7.	Ask questions in the ticket comments if anything is unclear or confusing. If you are not 100% sure about what needs to be done for a ticket, ask a question BEFORE starting work.  It is better to ask questions than to spend several hours working on the wrong thing.
8.	Be sure to read all parent tickets and related tickets before starting work.
9.	Always use the comments section for questions rather than using email or Skype.
10.	Before you close a ticket, your code should be fully commented.  There should be a description for each method, including a description of what the method does, what the parameters are, and what it returns.  Any complex commands should be commented.  All variable names should be clear, or they should be commented.  Whitespace and proper indentation should be used to keep code readable.you need to review your code and make sure it meets the requirements of our Good Coding Practices.  In that document, you will see our requirement for comments, whitespace, indentation, charsets, variable names, etc.  All code must comply with these requirements.  Double check all code BEFORE you push it to github.
11.	Closing Tickets:
o	When finished with a ticket, set the ticket to “test”
o	Always leave a comment with instructions on how to test the ticket.
o	Set the work remaining to 0
o	Assign the ticket to the person responsible for testing it
Daily Commits / Reports
1.	Push code to git daily.  The exception to this is if pushing changes will break something that is currently working.  In that case put a note in your daily report on StandUp that explains why you can’t push changes.
2.	All commits should have decent comments explaining what’s changed. 
3.	In the commit comments, reference any tickets involved using the keyword “refs”, “re”, or “see”.  So if you worked on ticket 5 you would put in your comments: “see #5”.  This will leave a comment on the ticket in assembla.
4.	When finished for the day, complete the daily summary form and post as a message onpaste it into the StandUp section of assembla.  Specific instructions can be found in the Report Template document.  You only need to paste the portion below the horizontal line.  This needs to be submitted every day that you work.  On days that you don’t work, you don’t need to submit a report.
Other
1.	At the beginning of each week, email a manager with any days you won’t be available or if you won’t be able to hit your hourly limit that week.
2.	When working on the project, we expect you to be on Skype in case we need to talk  about something you are currently doing.
3.	Avoid hard coding anything.  Use variables, database entries, config files, etc. instead
4.3.	When logging your time, we expect you to be reasonable.  Study time is not work time, and should not be logged as such.  If something took you a long time because you didn’t know how to do it, or you used the wrong method., it is not appropriate for you to bill us for that time (unless you get permission in advance).  You should adjust your hours to reflect the time needed to complete a task by someone who knows what they are doing.
