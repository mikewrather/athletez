	<div>It appears you're using an old version of IE ({{current_version}}).  Unfortunately our site is still in beta and we are not yet supporting versions older than IE 10.  If you're on Windows XP and are unable to upgrade to this version, please consider using Google Chrome, which is an outstanding browser that I recommend not just for this website, but for all websites.</div>
	<div><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank"><img src="http://cdn.athletez.com/resources/img/chrome.png" /> Here is a link to download Google's Chrome browser</a></div>

	<div>Looks like you're on a mobile browser.  Though it's high up on our priority list, Athletez is still in beta and we don't yet have support for mobile devices.  So trying to navigate on your phone will drive you insane.  If you don't want to go insane, maybe hold off on trying out Athletez until you get home.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  </div>
